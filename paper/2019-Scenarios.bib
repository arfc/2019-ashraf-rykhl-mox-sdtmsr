Inherent safety, liquid fuel, and possibility of online reprocessing and refueling are unique potentials of the SD-TMSR. In the present study, the Monte Carlo code Serpent2 has been chosen to model the full core of the SD-TMSR. In addition, online reprocessing and refueling has been modeled based on subroutine provided by Serpent2. During the burnup time (10 years), the total mass of the fuel inside the core has been checked and found to be almost constant. Furthermore, we controlled the reactivity by adjusting the feed rate of fissile and/or fertile materials. The change of Keff, breeding ratio, Th and U-233 refill rates with burn-up time have been investigated. Additionally, the build-up of U-233 during 10 years has been calculated.}

In this paper, the feedback coefficient and the breeding ratio are optimized based on the fuel-to-graphite ratio variation for a thorium based MSR (TMSR). A certain thermal core with negative feedback coefficient and relative high initial breeding ratio is chosen for the reprocessing scheme analysis. The breeding performances for the TMSR under different online fuel reprocessing efficiencies and frequencies are evaluated and compared with other MSR concepts. The results indicate that the thermal TMSR can get a breeding ratio greater than 1.0 with appropriate reprocessing scheme. The low fissile inventory in thermal TMSR leads to a short doubling time and low transuranic (TRU) inventory. The lifetime of graphite used for the TMSR is also discussed."

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor (MSR) shows great promise of high thermal-electric conversion efficiency, inherent safety, and on-line reprocessing. Furthermore, fuel breeding can be realized in both thermal and fast spectrum reactors with Th-U fuel cycle, which can make use of the abundant resource of thorium. In order to combine the advantages of high breeding ratio (BR) in fast spectrum and low fissile inventory for criticality in thermal spectrum, a single-fluid double-zone thorium-based molten salt reactor (SD-TMSR) core configuration is proposed. First, assemblies in both the inner and the outer zones are optimized by adjusting the ratios of molten salt and graphite with consideration of BR, 233U inventory, double time (DT), and temperature coefficient of reactivity (TCR) at the startup time, aiming to have a minimal DT for fuel breeding and a negative TCR for security. The results show that DT has the optimum value when the ratios of molten salt and graphite in the inner zone and the outer zone are 0.357 and 1.162, respectively. And the TCR can be improved to −2 pcm/K when the side length of the graphite hexagonal prism is 7.5 cm. Then, based on the optimized geometry, the burn-up calculations with a series of on-line reprocessing rates are carried out with a self-developed MSR reprocessing sequence (MSR-RS). The results show that on-line reprocessing is beneficial to the Th-U fuel breeding. When the reprocessing rate is 200 l/d, iso-breeding can be achieved. When the reprocessing rate is 5 m3/d, the performance of Th-U breeding is improved significantly, and only 16 years is needed for the 233U doubling. The results also show that TCR remains negative and inherent safety is satisfied during all the operation time.},

The aim of this paper is; modeling the primary circuit of MSFR (European model), in order to optimize the concentration of the startup liquid fuel using code Serpent 2. According to the results, the concentrations of the start-up liquid fuel required for criticality and long life cycle were 3 mol% of 233UF4, 6 mol% of PuF3 and 6.5 mol% of TRUF3 respectively. The multiplication factors as a function of burnup have been calculated for different fissile materials. In conclusion, during 500 EFPD the MSFR was self-sustained regardless of the type of fissile materials used. The PuF3 and TRUF3 fuels appear to be prospective fuels compared to the 233UF4 fuel.}

The simulation started with the reference composition from the original Oak Ridge National Laboratory MSBR design. Equilibrium compositions were obtained from depletion and reprocessing simulations 7000 days worth of data. The MSBR whole core analysis was performed at the initial and equilibrium core conditions, for various reactor design parameters such as multiplication factors, neutron flux distributions, temperature coefficients, rod worths, and power distributions. The neutronic core characteristics were analyzed using a four-factor formula applied to the two zones of the core separately. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The active core of the SD-TMSR is divided into the inner zone (486 fuel tubes) and the outer zone (522 fuel tubes) to improve the Th-U3 breeding performance. This work adopted the SERPENT-2 Monte Carlo code to analyze the whole core model of the SD-TMSR. Built-in SERPENT-2 capabilities simulated online reprocessing and refueling and calculated the multiplication factor and Breeding Ratio (BR). We found that the molten salt Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity (αT) was negative for initial and equilibrium states. This study investigated the variation of the multiplication factor, BR, and build-up of important nuclides in the core as a function of burnup. Under online reprocessing and refueling, we studied the variation of the reactivity during 60 years of reactor operation. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation was calculated. Finally, these simulations determined the appropriate 232Th and 233U feed rates for maintaining criticality and enabled analysis of the overall SD-TMSR fuel cycle performance."

	url = {https://zenodo.org/record/3355649#.XZuyEEFKjdI},
	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged 
	in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in 
	Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear 
	power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing 
	electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts 
	(such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In 
	steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same 
	rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts 
	start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a 
	buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again 
	increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the 
	byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive 
	decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these 
	unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load 
	following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a 
	flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, 
	outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The 
	team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted 
	byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major 
	barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors. Toward this work, 
	we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to 
	more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic 
	Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1 [1–3], was developed to 
	represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt 
	Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an advanced SaltProc version 
	(SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt 
	fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP system, incorporating 
	user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This
