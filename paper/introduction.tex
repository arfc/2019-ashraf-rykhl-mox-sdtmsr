\section{Introduction} \label{Introduction}
The \gls{GIF} defines eight technological goals for the next generation
nuclear systems. These goals are defined in four broad areas: safety and reliability, non-proliferation and physical protection, economics, and sustainability \cite{doe2002technology}. The \gls{MSR} has many advantages that agree
with \gls{GIF}'s goals, like: liquid fuel, inherent safety, online
reprocessing and refueling, excellent neutron economy, and operation near
atmospheric
pressure in a primary loop \cite{siemer2015molten,rosenthal1970molten}.
Thus, the \gls{GIF} selected the \gls{MSR} as one of the promising Generation-IV
reactors \cite{doe2002technology,pioro2016handbook}.
In \glspl{MSR}, the fuel is dissolved in a molten salt (e.g., LiF or NaCl) \cite{betzler_impacts_2019};
this liquid fuel salt (e.g., LiF-BeF$_2$-ThF$_4$-$^{233}$UF$_4$) constantly
circulates through the core and allows fission heat to transfer from the reactor
core to intermediate heat exchangers.

The Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (SD-TMSR) with a thermal power of 2,250
MW$_{th}$ was proposed for the first time by ORNL as early as in the 1960s, which was called Molten salt breeding reactor (MSBR) \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}.
The SD-TMSR is a graphite-moderated thermal-spectrum \gls{MSR} operating in Th/$^{233}$U
fuel cycle. In the SD-TMSR, the fissile and fertile elements are integrated
into a single salt. To improve the breeding ratio, the active core is divided into two zones:
the radius of the fuel channels in the outer zone is modified to be larger
than the radius of the fuel channels in the inner zone \cite{li_optimization_2018}.

Historically, the thermal-spectrum \gls{MSR} was designed for the Th/$^{233}$U
fuel cycle \cite{rykhlevskii2019modeling,nuttin2005potential,
	merle2004scenarios,rosenthal1970molten}. This design assumes that we have
fissile $^{233}$U inventory to start up new \glspl{MSR}. However, $^{233}$U does not
exist in the Earth's crust and can only be produced from fertile $^{232}$Th in 
specific nuclear facilities. Therefore, we examine alternative fissile
materials to replace the $^{233}$U in the startup fuel
composition \cite{betzler2016modeling,zou2018transition}. The thorium fuel
cycle transition can be achieved after reaching the doubling
time of $^{233}$U (required time to produce enough $^{233}$U to start up a new unit) because in this case, all startup fissile material
is being substituted by newly produced $^{233}$U.

Betzler \emph{et al.} (2016) discussed the simulation of the startup of a \gls{MSBR} unit
cell with \gls{LEU} (19.79\%) and Pu from \gls{LWR} spent nuclear fuel (SNF) as initial
fissile materials \cite{betzler2016modeling}. They concluded that the 
Pu vector extracted from LWR SNF is the best alternative source to 
$^{233}$U because it has a high ratio of fissile isotopes
\cite{betzler2016modeling}. Zou \emph{et al.} (2018) introduced two approaches for
the thorium fuel cycle transition in the \gls{TMSR}: (1) in-core transition and 
(2) ex-core transition. In the first approach, the TMSR is launched with 
existing fissile material and thorium as a fertile material; then the 
$^{233}$U bred from thorium is rerouted into the core to maintain criticality. 
In contrast, the second approach tends to store produced $^{233}$U out of the 
core until there is enough to start a new TMSR \cite{zou2018transition}.

Cui \emph{et al.} (2017-2018) used an in-house developed tool to study the thorium fuel cycle transition based on MSBR by employing enriched uranium and Pu as the startup fissile materials. Two scenarios, a Breeding and Burning (B\&B) scenario and a Pre-breeding scenario, were investigated to achieve the fuel cycle transition. Cui \emph{et al.} found that the fuel transition can be achieved by using: (1) enriched uranium with greater than 40\% concentration of $^{235}$U (2) Pu from LWR (burn-up of 60 GWd/t) spent nuclear fuel by applying 60 days of chemical reprocessing \cite{cui2017transition,cui2018possible}.

Zou \emph{et al.} (2018) studied the transitioning to thorium fuel
cycle in a small modular Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (smTMSR) using \gls{TRU}
as startup fuel. They concluded that the transition to a thorium fuel cycle can
be achieved in a thermal smTMSR with a proper fuel fraction 
\cite{zou2018preliminary}.

Heuer \emph{et al.} (2014) discussed the transition characteristics of the \gls{MSFR}
under different launching scenarios (e.g., enriched uranium and TRU); they concluded that starting the thorium fuel cycle is feasible in the MSFR while closing the current fuel cycle and optimizing the management of the long-term wastes \cite{heuer2014towards}.

Various previous works explore starting the
\glspl{MSR} with fissile materials alternative to $^{233}$U. Many such publications have focused on the fast-spectrum \glspl{MSR} \cite{heuer2014towards,ashraf2019modeling,
	ashraf2018nuclear, rykhlevskii_fuel_2019, betzler_impacts_2019,
	fiorina2013investigation}, while few focus on
thermal-spectrum \glspl{MSR} \cite{betzler2016modeling,
	zou2018transition,zou2018preliminary}.
The main objective of the present paper is to establish feasible strategies for thorium fuel cycle transition in the SD-TMSR with
various initial fissile materials and without any external feed of $^{233}$U. We investigate five different
initial fissile materials: \gls{HALEU}, Pu mixed with \gls{HALEU}, reactor-grade Pu \footnote{Reactor-grade Pu is a mixture of Pu isotopes chemically extracted from PWR SNF with 33 GWd/tHM burnup} \cite{marka1993explosive}, \gls{TRU} from LWR SNF \cite{de2000scenarios}, and $^{233}$U. Two different feed mechanisms were selected:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Thorium feed mechanism}: continuous feed flow of thorium from the external stockpile and $^{233}$U from the \texttt{Pa-decay tank}\footnote{An external tank used to store protactinium extracted from the core.}, where the removal rate of $^{233}$Pa = feed rate of $^{233}$U \cite{betzler2016modeling}.
	\item \textbf{Non-thorium feed mechanism}: continuous injection of external heavy metals (\gls{HALEU}, Pu mixed with \gls{HALEU}, reactor-grade Pu, \gls{TRU}) and simultaneous feed of all or fraction of $^{233}$U from the \texttt{Pa-decay tank}.
\end{itemize}

$^{233}$U is contaminated with $^{232}$U, which produced from parasitic (n,2n) reactions in $^{233}$Pa, or in $^{232}$Th, or in $^{233}$U itself. $^{208}$Tl a daughter of $^{232}$U emits intense $\gamma$-radiation and this makes $^{233}$U undesirable for nuclear weapons. Moreover, for nonproliferation reasons, bred $^{233}$U could be diluted with $^{238}$U to produce denatured fuel, which not suitable for nuclear weapons \cite{dolan2017molten}.

All calculations presented in this paper are performed using SERPENT-2 version 2.1.31\footnote{SERPENT-2 is a 3D continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron 
	transport and burnup code.} \cite{leppanen2014serpent}. We use the MSR burnup routine provided by SERPENT-2 to simulate continuous online reprocessing and refueling. SERPENT-2 uses an internal calculation routine for solving the Bateman equations describing the changes in the material compositions caused by neutron-induced reactions and radioactive decay \cite{leppanen2014serpent}. Additionally, SERPENT-2 enables burnup calculations on computer clusters with multiple cores using distributed-memory MPI parallelization.
